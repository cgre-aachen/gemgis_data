    "Welcome to the course \"From Maps to Models - Tutorials for structural geological modeling using GemPy and GemGIS\". In this course, you will learn how to obtain and process spatial data with the Python open-source package [GemGIS](https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gemgis), how to create structural geological models using the Python open-source package [GemPy](https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy) and how to post process the models to obtain certain information from your models. Both packages were developed and are maintained by departments of Prof. Florian Wellmann at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.cg3.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~qoyf/cg3/?lidx=1) and [Fraunhofer IEG](https://www.ieg.fraunhofer.de/de/geschaeftsbereiche/georessourcen.html). The course material is adapted from two undergraduate courses at RWTH Aachen University, Germany ([Geological methods and geological map](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/root/studium/Vor-dem-Studium/Studiengaenge/Liste-Aktuelle-Studiengaenge/Studiengangbeschreibung/~bqxx/Angewandte-Geowissenschaften-B-Sc/?lidx=1) & [Introduction to geological maps](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/root/studium/Vor-dem-Studium/Studiengaenge/Liste-Aktuelle-Studiengaenge/Studiengangbeschreibung/~bllm/Georessourcenmanagement-B-Sc/?lidx=1)).\n",

    "\n",
    "Structural geological models (sensu [Wellmann & Caumon, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.agph.2018.09.001)) represent geometric elements in the subsurface, so-called surfaces (Fig. 1). These surfaces may be lithological boundaries such as a boundary between a sandstone or a claystone, which are used mostly in this course, stratigraphic boundaries between layers of different age, which are mostly used in the real world, faults separating a continuous layer or intrusions. A layer is defined here as rock mass exhibiting the same properties such as lithology or stratigraphic age. A layer is bound by a top and a bottom surface. The structural geological model is created in the first place according to the stratigraphic principles of Steno (1669) that more recent strata are deposited roughly horizontally on top of older strata and that variations such as folded, faulted or unconformable layers are caused by geological event. \n",

    "\n",
    "The course of the layers can be observed on the surface in outcrops or quarries (Fig. 2). Further, direct observations of layer boundaries can be made in the subsurface in boreholes or indirectly using geophysical methods such as seismic representing the seismic impedance (product of rock density and seismic velocity). This course focuses on observations on the surface and in boreholes.\n",

The locations should be expressed in meters (m) rather than geographical coordinates (longitude/latitude). The dip and azimuth are expressed in degrees. The dip varies from 0° for horizontal layers to 90° for vertical layers. The azimuth varies from 0° (N) via 180° (S) to 360° (N). \n",

    "\n",
    "Structural geological models describe the spatial distribution of layers in the subsurface. This includes the extent and depth distribution of either lithological layers (e.g. sand or clay, sandstones, carbonates, evaporites, etc.) or stratigraphic units for more regional questions of the structure of the subsurface (e.g. Base Tertiary, transition to basement rocks, etc.). The resulting structures can be used to parametrize the rocks between these constructed bounding surfaces for a wide range of applications. These include but are not limited to hydrogeological applications, geohazards, ressource extraction (e.g. fresh water, thermal waters, hydrocarbons, minerals), storage applications (e.g. thermal waters, gases such as CO2 or hydrogen, nuclear waste)."

    "GemPy and GemGIS are two Python open-source packages developed and are maintained by departments of Prof. Florian Wellmann at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.cg3.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~qoyf/cg3/?lidx=1) and [Fraunhofer IEG](https://www.ieg.fraunhofer.de/de/geschaeftsbereiche/georessourcen.html). GemPy is capable of creating structural geological models based on an implicit modeling approach using universal co-kriging [(de la Varga et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-1-2019) and the potential field approach by [Lajaunie et al. (1997)](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02775087). \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple synclinal model is shown to illustrate the principles of GemPy (Fig. 4, left). The first input data used for the interpolation of geological surfaces, here stratigraphic surfaces, are the location (x, y, z) of stratigraphic boundaries mapped in surface outcrops, interpolated on geological maps, in wells or seismic data in the subsurface, or constrained from additional geophysical methods (e.g. gravity, ERT). Orientation data (x, y, z, dip, azimuth) obtained from outcrop measurements or reference values from literature are the second type of input data (Fig. 4, left. colored  arrows). Subparallel layers/formations are combined in one series and are interpolated using one scalar field/potential field where a certain isovalue of this field corresponds to the location of a stratigraphic boundary (Fig. 4, right). The measured orientations represent the gradient of the field (Fig. 4, right). Layers that are separated by an unconformity are modeled in separate series. The same accounts for faults where each fault is modeled as its own series. The order of the series and the formations from old at the bottom and young at the top with faults above the series and formations define the stratigraphic pile. This will be introduced in more detail during the modeling of basic structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpolation in GemPy is meshless working with a regular grid where the resulting layer or stratigraphic unit is assigned to the respective grid cell (voxel). The actual resulting structural geological model is therefore a so-called `lith_block` represented by a NumPy array. A marching-cube algorithm is applied to calculate the 2.5D surface meshes that can be visualized in PyVista [(Sullivan and Kaszynski, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01450) and that can be used for post-processing in GemGIS.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The GemGIS package has been developed as an Add-On to GemPy to accelerate and simplify the processing of spatial data as input data for the structural geological modeling with GemPy (Fig 5). It is wrapping and extends the functionality of already well-known spatial data open-source Python packages such as [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs.html) [(Bosche et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2585848) or [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Gillies et al., 2019).
