    "Structural geological models (sensu [Wellmann & Caumon, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.agph.2018.09.001)) represent geometric elements in the subsurface, so-called surfaces (Fig. 1). These surfaces may be lithological boundaries such as a boundary between a sandstone or a claystone, which are used mostly in this course, stratigraphic boundaries between layers of different age, which are mostly used in the real world, faults separating a continuous layer or intrusions. A layer is defined here as rock mass exhibiting the same properties such as lithology or stratigraphic age. A layer is bound by a top and a bottom surface. The structural geological model is created in the first place according to the stratigraphic principles of Steno (1669) that more recent strata are deposited roughly horizontally on top of older strata and that variations such as folded, faulted or unconformable layers are caused by geological event. \n",

This course focuses on observations on the surface and in boreholes.\n",

The locations should be expressed in meters (m) rather than geographical coordinates (longitude/latitude). The dip and azimuth are expressed in degrees. The dip varies from 0° for horizontal layers to 90° for vertical layers. The azimuth varies from 0° (N) via 180° (S) to 360° (N). \n",

    "## Introduction to GemPy and GemGIS\n",
    "\n",
    "GemPy and GemGIS are two Python open-source packages developed and are maintained by departments of Prof. Florian Wellmann at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.cg3.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~qoyf/cg3/?lidx=1) and [Fraunhofer IEG](https://www.ieg.fraunhofer.de/de/geschaeftsbereiche/georessourcen.html). GemPy is capable of creating structural geological models based on an implicit modeling approach using universal co-kriging [(de la Varga et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-1-2019) and the potential field approach by [Lajaunie et al. (1997)](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02775087). \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple synclinal model is shown to illustrate the principles of GemPy (Fig. 4, left). The first input data used for the interpolation of geological surfaces, here stratigraphic surfaces, are the location (x, y, z) of stratigraphic boundaries mapped in surface outcrops, interpolated on geological maps, in wells or seismic data in the subsurface, or constrained from additional geophysical methods (e.g. gravity, ERT). Orientation data (x, y, z, dip, azimuth) obtained from outcrop measurements or reference values from literature are the second type of input data (Fig. 4, left. colored  arrows). Subparallel layers/formations are combined in one series and are interpolated using one scalar field/potential field where a certain isovalue of this field corresponds to the location of a stratigraphic boundary (Fig. 4, right). The measured orientations represent the gradient of the field (Fig. 4, right). Layers that are separated by an unconformity are modeled in separate series. The same accounts for faults where each fault is modeled as its own series. The order of the series and the formations from old at the bottom and young at the top with faults above the series and formations define the stratigraphic pile. This will be introduced in more detail during the modeling of basic structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpolation in GemPy is meshless working with a regular grid where the resulting layer or stratigraphic unit is assigned to the respective grid cell (voxel). The actual resulting structural geological model is therefore a so-called `lith_block` represented by a NumPy array. A marching-cube algorithm is applied to calculate the 2.5D surface meshes that can be visualized in PyVista [(Sullivan and Kaszynski, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01450) and that can be used for post-processing in GemGIS.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The GemGIS package has been developed as an Add-On to GemPy to accelerate and simplify the processing of spatial data as input data for the structural geological modeling with GemPy (Fig 5). It is wrapping and extends the functionality of already well-known spatial data open-source Python packages such as [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs.html) [(Bosche et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2585848) or [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Gillies et al., 2019). In addition, it provides functions to utilize the created structural geological models further (creating virtual boreholes, creating depth maps, etc.). \n",
