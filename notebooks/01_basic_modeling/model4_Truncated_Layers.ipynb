    "\n",
    "The fourth and last notebook in this tutorial series builds upon the builds upon the [previous three notebooks](https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gemgis_data/tree/main/notebooks/01_basic_modeling) where parallel horizontal, parallel folded and parallel faulted layers were modeled. This notebook illustrates now how to create a simple model of unconformable layers in `GemPy`. The model consists of four layers of which only two are always parallel. These two groups (`Series`) of parallel layers are separated and truncated by an unconformity. The model has an extent of 1000 m by 1000 m with a vertical extent of 600 m. \n",
