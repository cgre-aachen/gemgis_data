    "Welcome to the main part of the course \"From Maps to Models - Tutorials for structural geological modeling using GemPy and GemGIS\". In this course, you will learn how to obtain and process spatial data with the Python open-source package [GemGIS](https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gemgis), how to create structural geological models using the Python open-source package [GemPy](https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy) and how to post process the models to obtain certain information from your models. Both packages were developed and are maintained by departments of Prof. Florian Wellmann at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.cg3.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~qoyf/cg3/?lidx=1) and [Fraunhofer IEG](https://www.ieg.fraunhofer.de/de/geschaeftsbereiche/georessourcen.html). The course material is adapted from two undergraduate courses at RWTH Aachen University, Germany ([Geological methods and geological map](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/root/studium/Vor-dem-Studium/Studiengaenge/Liste-Aktuelle-Studiengaenge/Studiengangbeschreibung/~bqxx/Angewandte-Geowissenschaften-B-Sc/?lidx=1) & [Introduction to geological maps](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/root/studium/Vor-dem-Studium/Studiengaenge/Liste-Aktuelle-Studiengaenge/Studiengangbeschreibung/~bllm/Georessourcenmanagement-B-Sc/?lidx=1)) taught by [Prof. Stefan Back](https://www.geol.rwth-aachen.de/cms/geol/Das-Institut/Team-CMS-Artikel-/~gnfmi/Stefan-Back/?allou=1) and [Prof. Susanne Buiter](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/staff/susanne.buiter/wv).

    "# Spatial Data Processing with GemGIS for Structural Modeling with GemPy\n",
    "\n",
    "The `GemGIS` package has been developed as an Add-On to `GemPy` to accelerate and simplify the processing of spatial data as input data for the structural geological modeling with GemPy. It is wrapping and extends the functionality of already well-known spatial data open-source Python packages such as [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs.html) [(Bosche et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2585848), [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Gillies et al., 2019) or [PyVista](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01450). Within the framework of this course, the different functionalities of `GemGIS` are introduced. The course covers six different sections ranging from simple planar dipping models all the way to combinations of faulted-folded models and special case models such as well-known three-point-problems. Each model will have an additional task to be solved with `GemGIS`. Further, useful functions for visualization and post-processing are introduced in each notebook.\n",

    "You should have basic knowledge in creating vector data (shape files) in geoinformation systems like [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/). QGIS is used to georeference the provided maps, digitize the data included in these maps (topographic contour lines, stratigraphic boundaries, strike lines, orientations, etc.). The vector data types that are mostly used are points and lines. All data is saved as shape files and will be loaded into Python using GeoPandas. \n",

    "\n",
    "Even though `GemPy` works spatially unaware, this is without considering a coordinate reference system (CRS), it is recommended to use a CRS to ensure that all data is projected correctly. As we are using sample models and no real world models, we mostly just use the CRS with the EPSG Code `4326`. EPSG stands for European Petroleum Survey Group Geodesy. EPSG 4326 is the World Geodetic System 1984 ensemble (Geodetic CRS: WGS 84) measured in longitude and latitude in degrees which is commonly used in GPS devices. However, we are not using the CRS for the correct projection but rather to only have defined a CRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maps used for the tutorial series are provided without a CRS and have to be georeferenced. We recommend using QGIS and the built-in georeferencer for this task. QGIS requires the four corner coordinates of the maps. If no scale is provided, the number of pixels may be used to define these points. Otherwise, you will have to convert the scale into real world coordinates. Once that is done, the digitalization of information on this map can start. \n",

    "\n",
    "After georeferencing the vector data, you need to digitize the information from the geological map. In this example, we have digitized the topographic lines to create a topography later on. Here, it is important to create a column `Z` when creating the shape file to store the altitude of the respective contour line as number. The second dataset we created are the layer boundaries between sandy formations (white) and a clay formation (gray). Here, it is important to create a column `formation` to store the name of the formation the layer boundary belongs to. However, already at this point, you have to decide which boundary is the top or the bottom of a certain formation to ensure the right order of the stratigraphic pile that is needed as input for `GemPy`. The created vector data will then be opened using `GeoPandas` and processed using `GemGIS` to create the input data sets for `GemPy`. These procedures are ellaborated on in more detail in the upcoming tutorials. \n",
